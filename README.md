## Note
- During testing, I utilized the GPT-3.5 turbo model, which has limitations in terms of available tokens. As a result, I constrained the AI to ask only 3 questions to avoid running out of tokens and having it repeat itself.
- To enhance its performance and capabilities, future iterations could benefit from utilizing GPT-4, a more powerful language model.
